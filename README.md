This project includes an Introduction to the Raspberry Pi presentation/class that I authored for MakerSpaceCT in Hartford Connecticut, USA

The intial class was in January 2020 so it does not include newer boards but should still be relevant.

The introduction includes the board and it's parts, several progammig examples and simple configurations.

Please feel free to use it but let us know by posting a note with your pull request.
